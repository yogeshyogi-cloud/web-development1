    <p>Vijay's father S. A Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director and his mother Shoba is a playb
      ack singer and carnatic vocalist. He had a sister Vidhya, who died when she was two years old. His sister's death affected Vijay greatly; according to his mother, Vijay, who was very talkative, naughty and hyperactive as a child, became silent after Vidhya's death. In her memory, Vijay named his production house, V.V Productions, which stands for Vidhya-Vijay productions This shows how much love he still holds for his departed sibling. Vijay married a fan, Sangeetha Sornalingam, a Sri Lankan Tamil whom he met in the United Kingdom, on 25 August 1999. They have two children, a son Jason Sanjay born in 2000 in London and a daughter Divya Shasha born in 2005 in Chennai. Jason Sanjay made a cameo appearance with his father in Vettaikaaran (2009) and Divya Shasha portrayed a small role as her father's pre-teen daughter in Theri (2016).</p>
